Sencha Ext4 MVC with nodejs and Mongoose. Try to get it work together in transparent.

It is not a library, but real app, and in the proccess i will do The Lib :)

sSide --> { readAs: 'server side' }
h2e4.js --> { nameAs: 'Helpers for Ext4' }

Goals:
Write less sSide code.
Write shared code (same code works on server and client side simultaneously)
Write sSide code in Ext4 Controller, or in separate file (with same structure as /app (?) )


TODO: 
Models: 
Validators on model (server/client side and shared)

Controllers:
Controllers server/client side (shared or separate files)

And too many more
PS: some of that are impemented on my previous project, named exp1(/lib/jsz.js - direct for ext4)(look at githib), but it is too dirty.

Works now:
Models ::
Now we need to define only Ext4 model, eg:

Ext.define('App.model.Org', {
	extend: 'Ext.data.Model',

	fields: [
		{ name: 'id', type: 'string' },
		{ name: 'stringField', type: 'string' },
		{ name: 'floatField', type: 'int' }
	],

});

When referring to that model from Ext4 client app(MVC), it is automatically translate(by lib/h2e4.js)
to mongoose model, in to form like that:

Mongoose.model({
		stringField: String,
		intField: Number,
}, new Schema('Org'));

Field 'id' simply ignored (by now).
